# Candidate Elimination Algorithm

This Python script implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm for concept learning. The algorithm maintains a specific hypothesis and a set of general hypotheses based on a set of examples. The specific hypothesis is refined, and the general hypotheses are generalized as the algorithm processes each example.

## Project Structure

1. **`candidate_elimination.py`:**
   - The main script containing the implementation of the Candidate Elimination algorithm.

2. **`examples.csv`:**
   - The dataset file containing examples. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.

3. **`README.md`:**
   - The README file providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the Candidate Elimination algorithm.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Candidate Elimination algorithm:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/candidate-elimination.git
   cd candidate-elimination
   ```

2. Ensure you have a CSV file named `examples.csv` with the appropriate examples.

3. Run the Candidate Elimination algorithm script:
   ```bash
   python candidate_elimination.py
   ```

   The script will output the specific and general hypotheses after processing the examples.

## Candidate Elimination Algorithm

The script implements the Candidate Elimination algorithm, which maintains a specific hypothesis and a set of general hypotheses. The specific hypothesis is refined, and the general hypotheses are generalized based on the provided examples.

## Example Dataset

The sample dataset used for demonstration is loaded from the `examples.csv` file. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.

## Output

The script prints the specific and general hypotheses after processing the examples.
